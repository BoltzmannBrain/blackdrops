## Installation of Black-DROPS code

Since Black-DROPS is a `limbo` experiment (check the [docs](http://www.resibots.eu/limbo/index.html) of limbo for details), there needs to be no installation. Nevertheless, the dependencies must be installed. We provide scripts for easy installation of the dependencies, configuration and compilation of the source code on Ubuntu-based and OSX systems. If you need a more controlled installation of the dependencies and/or configuration/compilation, please check the [advanced installation tutorial](advanced_installation.md) (this is recommended for users experienced with building systems and command line usage).

### How to properly clone this repo

- Clone the repo *recursively*: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/resibots/blackdrops.git` (or `git clone --recursive git@github.com:resibots/blackdrops.git`)

### Dependencies

#### Required
- Ubuntu (it should work on versions >= 14.04) or OSX
- limbo, https://github.com/resibots/limbo (for high-performing Gaussian process regression)
- libcmaes, https://github.com/beniz/libcmaes (for high-quality implementations of CMA-ES variants) --- recommended to use with TBB
- Eigen3 (needed by limbo and libcmaes)
- Boost (needed by limbo)
- NLOpt, http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt (needed by limbo)

#### Optional
- TBB, https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/ (for parallelization) --- highly recommended
- DART, http://dartsim.github.io/ (for scenarios based on DART) --- recommended
- robot\_dart, https://github.com/resibots/robot_dart (for scenarios based on DART) --- recommended
- SDL2 (for visualization of standard control scenarios; e.g., cart-pole)

### Installation of the dependencies

Some of the dependencies (libcmaes, DART, NLOpt, robot\_dart) require specific installation steps (e.g., compilation from sources). As such, we provide some scripts (under the `scripts` folder) for automatic installation of the dependencies (3 different categories):

#### Install the recommended dependencies

**This only works for Ubuntu systems.**

- `cd /path/to/repo/root` **(this is very important as the script assumes that you are in the root of the repo)**
- `./scripts/install_deps.sh`

#### Install all the dependencies

**This only works for Ubuntu systems.**

- `cd /path/to/repo/root` **(this is very important as the script assumes that you are in the root of the repo)**
- `./scripts/install_deps_all.sh`

#### Install only the required dependencies

- `cd /path/to/repo/root` **(this is very important as the script assumes that you are in the root of the repo)**
- `./scripts/install_deps_req.sh`

Using the scripts, all of the custom dependencies (limbo, libcmaes, DART, NLOpt, robot\_dart) will be installed in `/path/to/repo/root/install` in order not to pollute your linux distribution. As such, you should update your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or you can source the proper script --- see below). Consequently no `sudo` is required for these dependencies; nevertheless, `sudo` is still required for installing standard packages (like boost-dev packages, libeigen3-dev, etc).

### Compilation

As the Black-DROPS code is a `limbo` experiment and can sometimes be a bit tricky to compile, we provide the `configure.sh` and `compile.sh` scripts. The former needs to be ran once. The latter should compile all the Black-DROPS code. Even your own new scenarios should be compiled with this script (if the files are in the correct folders --- see [*''How to create your own scenario''*](basic_tutorial.md)). In short you should do the following:

- `cd /path/to/repo/root` **(this is very important as the scripts assume that you are in the root of the repo)**
- `./scripts/configure.sh`
- `./scripts/compile.sh`

And then every time you make a change to a source file (*\*.hpp or \*.cpp*), you should re-run the compilation script. If you want to know in more detail how to compile limbo experiments (i.e, not with the scripts), please check the quite extensive [documentation](http://www.resibots.eu/limbo/index.html) of limbo. In addition, if you want more fine-tuned compilation of your own scenarios, please check the [advanced installation tutorial](advanced_installation.md).

### Running scenarios

- Before running any executable you should source the proper paths: `source ./scripts/paths.sh` **(the script assumes that you are in the root of the repo)**
- All the executables including your own new scenarios (assuming the compilation produced no errors) should be located in the `deps/limbo/build/exp/blackdrops/src/` folder
- For example if we want to run the cartpole scenario without any visualization, we should use: `./deps/limbo/build/exp/blackdrops/src/classic_control/cartpole_simu [args]` (you can get help on what arguments to use, with `/path/to/binary --help`)
