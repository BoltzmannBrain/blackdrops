#| This software is the implementation of the Black-DROPS algorithm, which is
#| a model-based policy search algorithm with the following main properties:
#|   - uses Gaussian processes (GPs) to model the dynamics of the robot/system
#|   - takes into account the uncertainty of the dynamical model when
#|                                                      searching for a policy
#|   - is data-efficient or sample-efficient; i.e., it requires very small
#|     interaction time with the system to find a working policy (e.g.,
#|     around 16-20 seconds to learn a policy for the cart-pole swing up task)
#|   - when several cores are available, it can be faster than analytical
#|                                                    approaches (e.g., PILCO)
#|   - it imposes no constraints on the type of the reward function (it can
#|                                                  also be learned from data)
#|   - it imposes no constraints on the type of the policy representation
#|     (any parameterized policy can be used --- e.g., dynamic movement
#|                                              primitives or neural networks)
